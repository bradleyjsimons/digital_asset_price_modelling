# BTC Price Prediction: Integrating Blockchain and Market Data with Reinforcement Learning

## Description

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using a combination of blockchain metrics, market data, and reinforcement learning algorithms. It's currently in progress and includes data retrieval from blockchain.com and Yahoo Finance, data preprocessing and cleaning, and the addition of technical indicators into a Pandas DataFrame. The next steps will involve feature engineering, optimization, and developing a reinforcement learning environment.
