# Bitcoin Price Prediction: Integrating Blockchain and Market Data with Reinforcement Learning

## Description
This project is a sophisticated approach to predict Bitcoin prices using a combination of blockchain metrics, market data, and advanced reinforcement learning algorithms. The current state includes:

- Data retrieval from blockchain.com for blockchain metrics and Yahoo Finance for market data.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure quality and consistency.
- Addition of technical indicators and blockchain metrics as features in a comprehensive Pandas DataFrame.
- Ongoing work includes feature engineering and optimization to identify the most impactful features.

The upcoming phases will involve:
- Developing a reinforcement learning environment using Proximal Policy Optimization for price prediction.
- Rigorous backtesting of the model to validate its performance.

Each component of the project is thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and accuracy.
